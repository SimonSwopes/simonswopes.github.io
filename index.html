            <h3>Texas Tech University: Computer Science</h3>
            <div class="aboutTextBox">
                <p>I am an Undergraduate in Computer Science who is interested in making
                    impactful software. I learned my first programming language at an
                    engineering camp when I was 13. I fell in love with the way it requires
                    you to think. I've always enjoyed logic puzzles and problem solving.
                    This inspired me to go to Texas Tech in an attempt to turn my passion into
                    my career. I have loved everything I've learned from Data Structures and Algorithms
                    to Concepts of Programming Languages and Computer Architecture. As I approach my
                    comment day on August 3rd I am looking forward to not only applying these skills on
                    my personal projects, but using them to make a meaningful impact on the world around me.

                        <p>A golf app that was made for my some aquitences of mine.
                            They had an issue doing the math for the game when they
                            have been on the golf course all day. This was my first venture
                            into the React.js framework and cross-platform mobile develeopment.
                            I used agile develepment and a variation of extreme programming that
                            utilizes a single developer. I was to finish a working useable version
                            in under 2 months. I did my best to properly maintain documentation as well
                            for my own sake. This project was a lot of fun and I have a modified version
                            downloaded on my friend's phone who is very happy with it.

                            Programming. This was a group project that also taught me how software could
                            be developed in parrell in small teams. The project is twitter inspired, but instead of tweets you
                            have peeps. We included several error checking a command line menu.
