            <h3>Texas Tech University: Computer Science</h3>
            <div class="aboutTextBox">
                <p>I am an Undergraduate in Computer Science who is interested in making
                    impactful software. I learned my first programming language at an
                    engineering camp when I was 13. I fell in love with the way it requires
                    you to think. I've always enjoyed logic puzzles and problem solving.
                    This inspired me to go to Texas Tech in an attempt to turn my passion into
                    my career. I have loved everything I've learned from Data Structures and Algorithms
                    to Concepts of Programming Languages and Computer Architecture. As I approach my
                    comment day on August 3rd I am looking forward to not only applying these skills on
                    my personal projects, but using them to make a meaningful impact on the world around me.
